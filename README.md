# activate
The setup script for labs in discipline "Technologies and Methods of Programming"

## Notes:    
#### The "script" should not be used via `./activate.sh`. Instead clone the file to `scripts/activate.sh` and use `source` command.
#### Also you need to be in the `~/<GH USERNAME>/workspace` directory when running this script
